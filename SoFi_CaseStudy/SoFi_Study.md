# Case Study of SoFi

## Overview of SoFi and its Origins

### What is the name of the company?

* SoFi, which stands for Social Finance Inc.

### Why did I choose SoFi?

* As a newly recent small-time investor and a football fan, SoFi has an outward appearance of a high trajectory. In the week leading up to selecting my FinTech of choice, multiple people mentioned how highly they thought of SoFi. I don’t think it is a stretch for some to compare SoFi's build-up to Amazon’s build-up as this novice writer does in his article. Despite this, their current stock price suggests otherwise. [1]

### When Was the company incorporated?

* SoFi was incorporated in 2011. [2]

### Who are the founders of the company?

* Founded by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady. [2]

### How did the idea for the company come about?

* They were Stanford grads. The ideal came about like social leading for college tuition. During this time, we had many companies coming out or had been out solving problems using the collective of society to solve problems. Think lending club, wiki, kickstart, etc. They thought along those lines to allow Stanford alumni to invest in the rising college tuition problem. [3]

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

* SoFi has had a total of 20 funding rounds for a total of about $3 billion. Their latest one came on Jan 7, 2021. For 2021 they showed annual net revenue of over $1 billion. Lending makes up 75% of their annual revenue. [4] [5]

## Business Activites

### What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve?

* For SoFi, the initial problem was the rising cost of college tuition. Since then, they have turned into a digital personal finance company. If you go on their website, you can see all the products that range from loans, investing, credit cards, banking, insurance, insight, and business solutions. If you go to their member benefits, you can see things like career coaching, financial planning, and estate planning. [6] 

### Who is the company’s intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solutions does this company offer that its competitors do not or cannot offer?

* The current customer base is their members. One paper noted, “The target is the 25 to 40-year-old professionals who are ignored by traditional wealth managers and often stuck with high minimums if they want the advice of a professional.” I gathered from my research that they had a more target membership that has slowly gotten broader. Researching a personal loans page, they have a 680 credit score minimum and mentioned if your credit score is less than 700, to apply for different loans. Which tells me they are trying to stay in the professional higher middle-class target range. [7] [8]
* A slightly dated article went into a bit more detail about how around 2016, they seemed more targeted at the high-end customer. With troubling slogans like, “we can’t accept everyone, and we make no apology for that.” He pointed out It could become an issue if it leads to failure to scale your business. [9]
* The last customer base is banks, which I’ll explain in the next point. 

### What is SoFi doing that makes them stand out from their competitors? What technology is helping them acheive this?

* SoFi acquisitioned Galileo, Technisys, and Golden Pacific Bancorp Inc. Through these acquisitions SoFi has been able to increase it's products, features, and customer base.
* “SoFi acquired Galileo in May 2020 for $1.2 billion in cash and stock. The CEO has said SoFi wants Galileo to play a role similar to that of Amazon Web Services, providing technology infrastructure for credit unions, community banks, and regional banks.” [10]
* “Technisys has built an attractive, fast-growth business with a unique and critical strategic technology that all leading financial services companies will need in order to keep pace with digital innovation,” said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi. “The acquisition of Technisys is an essential building block in delivering on our member-centric, digital one-stop-shop experience for SoFi members and our partners through Galileo, our provider of fintech cloud services.” [11]
* In short this tells me they are trying to build the go-to for banks and trying to monopolize the technological infrastructure of the regional banks it supports while providing the front-end and back-end technical services. This means it probably wants to expand to more business customers worldwide as they undertake similar FinTech development. 
* "The decision to acquire Golden Pacific Bank, announced last year, was a key strategic step in SoFi’s path to obtaining a national bank charter, and was recently approved by the OCC and the Federal Reserve." ... "With this acquisition, SoFi will be able to offer improved features to members to help them get their money right. In the coming weeks, SoFi will offer better banking through, among other things, a more user-friendly interface, automated savings, as well as differentiated checking and savings accounts for easy budgeting." [12]
* This leads me to believe they have ambitious goals to compete national with banks such as Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, etc.

## Landscape

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* Digital Finance

### What have been the major trends and innovations of the domain over the last 5-10 years?

* "More digital-only banks"
* More controls, more options for customers
* More nonbanking firms adding financial services
* Desire for human or personal touch still in demand despite the digital transformation [13]

### What are the other major companies in this domain?

* Given SoFi’s broad amount of products, multiple lists came up as competitors. Here are a couple of which I’ve complied.
* “We have compiled a list of solutions reviewers voted as the best overall alternatives and competitors to Sofi, including Finflux, TurnKey Lender, Sageworks Lending, and FIS Commercial Lending Suite.” [14]
*When looking at some top personal loan reviews, these came up: Upstart, Lightstream, upgrade, Marcus by Goldman, discover, happy money, best egg, and universal credit. [15]

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* I didn't include legacy banks above like Chase, Bank of America, etc., because they aren’t as heavy in the FinTech, but I believe they are doing everything they can to catch up or stay ahead. One example would Bank of America creation of Zelle or the example of Goldman Sachs hiring former Alphabet’s Jared Cohen just last week. [16]

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* The top metric would be revenue, the current CEO said he planned to have SoFi in the 50 billion per year range before he is done.
* Members or customers. The more customers you have the more you have a database of users you can pull from and adverstise new services too. Per their website "nearly 4 million." [6]
* Products and services, what are the different ways you can tap into your customer base? Based on their website the amount of services they provide is substantial.

### How is your company approaching it's competitiveness in the digital banking domain?

* Given the acquisitions SoFi has made I think one article summed up their approach correctly, "The industry is realizing this is a marathon, not a sprint." [17]

### To answer my question of why I choose SoFi, why is their stock beat down?

* I didn't come across a clear answer to this. I would argue it appeared to be a combition of perception that the student loan moratorium is hurting their bottom line is the biggest factor. They had to adjust their 2022 projections based off the extension of the moratorium alone.
* Their stock was overvalued compared to it's competitors when you break it down in price-to-sales ratio.
* The aqcusitions projections didn't add as much short term value as they cost.
* Obviously the overal market is bear. Investors are concerned with overvalued and under capitalize venture will come that could leave them exposed. SoFi doesn't appear to be under capitalized but overvalued and maybe over extended with it's acqusitions could bring it into question.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise what product in the FinTech would you recomment they look into?

* I listened to a podcast on Grain, a FinTech tapping into the personal loan services using a different approach than credit scores. The argument that their are segments of the population that can afford to payback loans based on cash flow but not credit scores. This could be for different reasons like they had a finacial emergency and their credit score took a hit as a result. If you ask me it's a holistic approach that I can relate to pesonally. By using different metrics they can asses if a person is more likely to payback their loan or not. [18]

### How do you think offering this product could help your company?

* I think offering this would allow them to hit a different customer base. They offer products like financial management and career coaching. By tapping into customer bases early into their journey to financial sucess SoFi can build more robust and loyal membership base. 

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Creating a successful algorithm that can distigush which customers should be given loans and how much. Just like their current personal loans the customers should be able to find out in minutes through the technologies they already use.
