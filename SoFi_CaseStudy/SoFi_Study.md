# Case Study of SoFi

## Overview of SoFi and its Origins

*What is the name of the company?

SoFi, which stands for Social Finance Inc.

*Why did I choose SoFi?

As a newly recent small-time investor and a football fan, SoFi has an outward appearance of a high trajectory. In the week leading up to selecting my FinTech of choice, multiple people mentioned how highly they thought of SoFi. I don’t think it is a stretch for some to compare SoFi build-up to Amazon’s build-up as this novice writer does in his article. Despite this, their current stock price suggests otherwise. [1]

*When Was the company incorporated?

SoFi was incorporated in 2011. [2]

*Who are the founders of the company?

Founded by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady. [2]

*How did the idea for the company come about?

They were Stanford grads. The ideal came about like social leading for college tuition. During this time, we had many companies coming out or had been out solving problems using the collective of society to solve problems. Think lending club, wiki, kickstart, etc. They thought along those lines to allow Stanfords alumni to invest in the rising college tuition problem. [3]

*How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

SoFi has had a total of 20 funding rounds for a total of about $3 billion. Their latest one came on Jan 7, 2021. For 2021 they showed annual net revenue of over $1 billion. Lending makes up 75% of their annual revenue. [4] [5]

## Business Activites

*What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve?

For SoFi, the initial problem was the rising cost of college tuition. Since then, they have turned into a digital personal finance company. If you go on their website, you can see all the products that range from loans, investing, credit cards, banking, insurance, insight, and business solutions. If you go to their member benefits, you can see things like career coaching, financial planning, and estate planning. [6] 

*Who is the company’s intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solutions does this company offer that its competitors do not or cannot offer?

The current customer base is their members. One paper noted, “The target is the 25 to 40-year-old professionals who are ignored by traditional wealth managers and often stuck with high minimums if they want the advice of a professional.” I gathered from my research that they had a more target membership that has slowly gotten broader. Researching a personal loans page, they have a 680 credit score minimum and mentioned if your credit score is less than 700, to apply for different loans. Which tells me they are trying to stay in the professional higher middle-class target range. [7] [8]

A slightly dated article went into a bit more detail about how around 2016, they seemed more targeted at the high-end customer. With troubling slogans like, “we can’t accept everyone, and we make no apology for that.” He pointed out It could become an issue if it leads to failure to scale your business. [9]

The last customer base is banks, which I’ll explain in the next point.
